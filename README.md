# Personal Website

Hello, don't know why anyone other than me would read this, but glad you're here!

View the website [here](https://samthedude.github.io/) if you want to.

## Running Page

This uses Jekyll, to read more about it and how it works with Github Pages look [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)

Standard ruby bundler install using `bundle install`, this is all developed and tested using ruby version 3.0.1 so no guarantees outside of that. Tbh, no guarantees inside of that either.

Run using `jekyll serve` or `bundle install jekyll serve` if you're feeling extra cautious today.
